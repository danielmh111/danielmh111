# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

**Data Engineer** at Digital i | **MSc Data Science** student at UWE Bristol

Currently living the best of both worlds - building data pipelines by day and diving into statistical theory by night. I love the challenge of turning messy streaming platform data into insights that matter, whether that's optimizing a pipeline from 2 days to 2 hours or exploring new machine learning techniques in my studies.

After I "accidentally" became a data engineer by applying for a 2-month summer analyst role, I that the best opportunities often come from staying curious and saying yes to new challenges.

## 🛠️ What I Work With

**Languages:** Python, SQL, R (starting to learn Rust as well)  
**Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, data modeling, database optimization  
**Analytics & ML:** pandas, scikit-learn, tidyverse, statistical modelling  
**Databases:** Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, QuestDB, experience with both relational and time-series data  
**Tools:** Dagster, DBT, Docker, Git, Quarto

*Always picking up something new - recently exploring geospatial analysis and advanced statistical methods*

## 📊 Featured Work

### [Advanced Statistics Analysis](link)
Comprehensive statistical analysis in R covering supervised/unsupervised learning and bootstrap sampling. My first major R project - proud of how the methodology and presentation turned out.

### [Air Quality Data Pipeline](link)
Built ETL pipelines and designed database schemas for environmental sensor data, including geospatial analysis and time-series optimization with QuestDB.

*More projects in my [repositories](link) - I aim for work that shows technical depth rather than just following tutorials*

## 🎯 Current Journey

- **2023-Present:** Data Engineer at Digital i - optimizing pipelines for streaming platform analytics
- **2024-2026:** Part-time MSc Data Science - deepening my theoretical foundations while working full-time
- **What's Next:** Planning summer hackathons and IoT sensor projects, plus thinking about thesis research

I've discovered I love helping other students navigate their own learning journeys - there's something satisfying about sharing hard-won lessons and reducing someone else's stress about breaking into the field.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I'm energized by **learning** and **problem-solving** - whether that's theoretical statistics, optimizing a stubborn pipeline, or figuring out how to bridge technical and business needs. I don't mind getting stuck - I just hate going through the motions.

My dream role? Something where I can use all my engineering skills on research problems that actually matter - think research scientist/engineer tackling challenging, societally important questions.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

Always up for discussions about data engineering challenges, interesting research problems, or just sharing what we're learning. Especially if you're a student figuring out your path - happy to share my (admittedly unconventional) experience!
