# Hi, I'm Daniel

**Data Engineer** at Digital i | **MSc Data Science** student at UWE Bristol

I'm working full-time building data pipelines while doing a part-time masters in data science. Most of my work involves turning streaming platform data into something useful (data modelling, integrating apis, designing and building pipelines, setting up warehouses and cloud infra) - and I'm constantly picking up new ML techniques through my studies.

I kind of fell into data engineering by accident (applied for a 2-month summer analyst role and ended up staying on as an engineer), but it turns out I really enjoy it. The best opportunities often come from just staying curious and being willing to try new things.

## What I Work With

**Languages:** Python, SQL, R (starting to learn Rust as well)  
**Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, data modeling, database optimization  
**Analytics & ML:** pandas, scikit-learn, statistical modelling  
**Databases:** Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, QuestDB  
**Tools:** Dagster, DBT, Docker, Git, Quarto

Always picking up something new. Recently that's been geospatial analysis, some webscraping and more advanced statistical methods.

## Featured Work

### [Advanced Statistics Analysis](link)
Comprehensive statistical analysis in R covering supervised/unsupervised learning and bootstrap sampling. This was my first major R project and I'm pretty happy with how both the methodology and presentation turned out.

### [Air Quality Data Pipeline](link)
Built ETL pipelines and designed database schemas for environmental sensor data. Includes geospatial analysis and time-series optimization with QuestDB.

More projects in my [repositories](link) - I try to focus on work that shows actual technical depth rather than just tutorial follow-alongs.

## Current Journey

- **2023-Present:** Data Engineer at Digital i, working on streaming platform analytics
- **2024-2026:** Part-time MSc Data Science, building strong theoretical foundations in ml and ai
- **What's Next:** Research projects, hopefully producing some cool tools and interesting papers.
  
I've found I enjoy helping other students figure out their path in this field. If you're trying to break into data engineering or just navigating the learning process, happy to share what I've learned (often the hard way).

I'm motivated by learning and problem solving - whether that's theoretical statistics, optimizing a stubborn pipeline, or figuring out how to bridge technical and business needs. I don't mind getting stuck on hard problems, I just hate going through the motions on easy ones.

Long term, I'd love to end up in a role where I can apply engineering skills to research problems that actually matter - something like a research scientist/engineer position working on challenging, important questions.

## Let's Connect

Always up for discussions about data engineering, interesting research problems, or just comparing notes on what we're learning. Especially if you're a student trying to figure things out.

When I'm not coding or studying, I'm either cooking something ambitious or following way too many sports at once.
